# Daniel's Dotfiles

My personal Linux dotfiles. I use EndeavourOS on my desktop and Arch on my laptop.

This repository can be thought of as beginning in my $HOME directory.

Currently I'm using `yadm` to manage these dotfiles. Thus if you see a file with a weird name, like `config##hostname.dbox`, it's leveraging `yadm`'s alternate files feature; the program will automatically symlink that file to its appropriate destination depending on which computer is using the repo.
