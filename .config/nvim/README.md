# ðŸ’¤ FicVim

My personal Neovim configuration based on [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).

Currently I'm using `obsidian.nvim` along with the Obsidian app for my notes and task management. I write all my notes in Neovim and read them or interact with my tasklist in the app. I'm also planning out a plugin which will scan the Obsidian vault for checklist items, populating a buffer as a sort of master todo list.
