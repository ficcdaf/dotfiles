# Daniel's Dotfiles

**Important**: I'm now hosting my dotfiles on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/ficcdaf/dotfiles). This repository does **not** serve as a mirror.

I'm keeping the commit history up for historical purposes. However, _all_ future pushes will happen on Codeberg. I continue to use GitHub for my other software projects.
